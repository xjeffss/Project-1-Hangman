# Project-1-Hangman
Hangman game
Bronze
Create a game of hangman where a user can enter a word for another player to guess on the webpage
The entered word must be broken into a string and stored as a string array of consecutive letters and use a for loop to check for a match.
Need a solution to populate boxes or dashes for the word and make the number of boxes or dashes equal the .length of the string array
Should the letter entry by typed in or clicked?  Could use divs for the letters and use click event to pull innerText to push to the other boxes
to populate the hangman, use a counter to increment with an if/else statement if the letter guessed is not in the word.  Each number is associated with an addition to the hangman
